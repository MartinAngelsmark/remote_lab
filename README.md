## Collaborating with your lab partner

Ways to talk & share your screen:
* DFN [link](https://www.conf.dfn.de/)
* Skype

# Using skype to collaborate with your lab partner
To install Skype, follow [link](https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/download-skype-for-desktop/)

Keeping the fact the lab students and tutor have a Skype app already installed  on their respective devices/laptops and have an account , the easiest way  to collaborate will be to create a Skype group with name of the chat group set as the group name, for e.g: “E213: PXX”.

a. The students should send in their Skype id’s to the tutor before the scheduled lab date, so that the tutor can make a Skype group and add both the students. The tutor will initiate the group call at the scheduled lab time, predecided by the students and the tutor, and will explain/ instruct the students about the lab course/ tasks that they have to perform on the day and any instructions in general. 

b. This skype group is only for collaboration/ discussion among the students while doing the lab course, for e.g. if the two students need to discuss something, share some plots etc. This can be effectively done via the screen sharing option which is usually shown while doing a group call and of course they can send some plots etc. inside the normal chat also. 

For screen sharing: follow [link]( https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34895/screen-sharing-in-skype)

c. If the students also want the tutor to join the call, to report/ clarify or show them the progress, they can simply just leave a message on the group to notify the tutor so that he/she can “join the call”/ initiate the call on time (For this the tutors should be available online on Skype for most of the time during the day,  the lab is conducted).

d. The students should mutually agree between each other in presence of the tutor (before the actual lab session starts) about the tasks they want to split, so that they can simultaneously work on these tasks and discuss among each other or with the tutor as described in point b and c respectively.

e. To end the lab session for the day, the students can simply message the tutor or ask him/her for a group call and discuss the strategy for the next day.

# Using skype for oral exam:

a. The oral exam will be conducted separately for each student of the lab course (for a period of 30 minutes?).
The tutor will separately notify the students regarding their individual time slot.

b. The tutor  will contact the student on their respective time slot, and will conduct the oral exam. This will be via a video chat

c. To conduct a fair exam, the students should give a scan of the room/place thy are sitting so as to ensure the tutor that they are not using any unforeseen cheating material.

d. If the oral exam requires the student to draw something, they can use the Paint app (?) simply installable, open it on their screens, start the screen sharing option and draw/represent accordingly whatever is asked by the tutor.

## Oral exam

Ways to sketch things (anything goes really, just some recommendations):
